# Portfolio Animation Implementation

## Overview
This portfolio website has been enhanced with comprehensive scroll-triggered animations using Framer Motion. The implementation includes:

## Features Implemented

### ðŸŽ­ Core Animation System
- **Scroll-triggered animations**: Elements animate as they enter the viewport
- **Parallax effects**: Background elements move at different speeds for depth
- **Staggered animations**: Sequential appearance of related elements
- **Hover interactions**: Micro-interactions on interactive elements

### ðŸŽ¯ Component Animations

#### Hero Section
- Parallax background elements
- Staggered text entrance animations
- Animated scroll indicator
- Interactive hover effects on CTA buttons

#### Selected Work Section
- Header slide-in animations
- Staggered project card reveals
- Filter button hover effects
- Category tag animations

#### About Section
- Text content entrance animations
- Animated skill bars that fill on scroll
- Profile image hover effects
- Decorative element animations

#### Contact Section
- Staggered form field animations
- Input focus effects
- Contact info icon hover animations
- Form interaction feedback

#### Footer Section
- Entrance animations
- Social media link hover effects

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

#### Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/useAnimations.js`)
- `useScrollAnimation()` - Tracks scroll position
- `useIntersectionObserver()` - Detects element visibility
- `useScrollTrigger()` - Combines scroll and intersection detection
- `useStaggerAnimation()` - Creates sequential animations
- `useReducedMotion()` - Respects accessibility preferences

#### Animation Variants
- Consistent timing and easing across components
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Performance-optimized intersection observers

#### CSS Enhancements (`src/index.css`)
- Custom animation utilities
- Gradient text effects
- Card hover effects
- Parallax utilities
- Custom scrollbar styling
- Reduced motion media queries

### â™¿ Accessibility
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Provides alternative static presentations
- Maintains keyboard navigation
- Preserves semantic structure

### ðŸš€ Performance
- Uses intersection observers for efficient scroll detection
- Lazy animation triggering
- Hardware-accelerated transforms
- Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies

## Usage
The animations are automatically active when the development server is running. Scroll through the page to see the various effects trigger as elements come into view.

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach
